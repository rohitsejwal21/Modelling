/*
Changing the Scale of Distance
If we want to build a logistic regression model with the distance (between the rider's current location and the pickup location),
as the feature and the rider's acceptance as output, 
what would be the meaning of the coefficient of the feature? 
What will happen to the model if we change the scale of the distance (from the mile to km, or from km to m)?
*/

Points:

Features of current location and pickup can give us a distance metric. 
Which since is just 1 metric, 
change in scale will not matter as opposed to cases with more features.

Now, 

Let's say,
Log(Odds Ratio) = 2 - 0.15 * Distance

What this means is:
Coefficient is 0.15, and sign is negative. So, every 1 unit increase in distance means e ^ 0.15 = 1.16, 
means 16% less chances that driver accepts the ride. Since, Odds Ratio = EXP(Coefficients)
