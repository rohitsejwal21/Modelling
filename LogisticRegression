/*
Do you think an additional feature improves Logistic Regression more?
*/

Logistic Regression mostly involves assumption of linearly separable data. 
Adding more dimensions or features with low collinearity will help gain more and more linearly separable data in higher dimension. 
In that regard, it can help Logistic Regression along with regularisation feature which can be used with more squared parameters. 

Downsides are obvious that too many dimensions might need more amount of data for conclusive and definite answers, 
otherwise the dimensionality increase would mostly be a burden which can be somehow managed with Regularisation again. 
So, more upsides for Logistic Regression.
