/*
Logistic Regression and Odds Ratio
What are the relationships between the coefficient in the logistic regression and the odds ratio?
*/

Odds Ratio: Ratio of success of event to the failure of event.

OR = P(x) / (1 - P(x)), simply p/(1-p)

Coefficients of Logistic Regression:
w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + --wNxN = Log(p/(1-p))

Or, p/(1-p) = exp(coefficients)
