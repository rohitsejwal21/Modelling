Regression is a task to predict an event based on the previously gathered information.
This prediction is mostly continuous value and not simple True/False value.

A simple example could be:
You take 5 minutes to reach your school, and the distance is just 1km away from your home;
Your friend takes 15 minutes to reach school and the distance is 4km;
Your other friend reaches in 30 minutes, and the distance is 7km.

So, if the teacher takes 25 minutes, and you have to guess how much kms: you could say something around 5-6km based on what others take.
