/*
Logistic Regression and Linear Regression
When you are doing logistic regression, how do you assess your model? 
What is the different compared to simple linear regression?
*/

Points:

Essentially when we are doing Logistic Regression we try and find the best plane that can linearly separate our data. 
So, in that case being a classification model, the cost function which minimises our loss is different as opposed to Linear Regression,
which essentially is a Regression technique trying to predict continuous values and hence uses a cost function like reducing the Mean Squared Error.

The accuracy measures for classification model can be:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- Log Loss
- F1 score
- AUC

The accuracy measures for Regression model can be:
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2
- Root Mean Squared Error
